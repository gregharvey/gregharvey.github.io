      Anyone who knows me and knows the UK Drupal community will likely know of
      the split between Code Enigma (CE) and Steve Parks (SP), former
      director and co-founder, in the summer of 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's been knawing at me for a long time to tell my side of things -
      especially since I've remained tight-lipped about what went on, because a
      public spat helps no one and just looks bad, though I know SP has been
      anything but silent, or accurate - but with things more or less wound up,
      I've decided to write a quick summary of my viewpoint down, if only for my
      own peace of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's actually pretty simple. Disappointingly so, if you're into
      community drama. Essentially:
      </p>

    <p>
      Probably about a year after CE was formed the three directors, myself,
      SP and Steve Cowie (SC), started to really struggle to work together. The
      only thing I can put this down to is personality clashes. Whoever's "fault"
      that might be doesn't really matter, the fact was the CE directors were not
      a functional board. We weren't capable of making and sticking to decisions,
      we were in total disagreement on some critical points, the group dynamic had
      broken down, we were on bad terms, we weren't getting on.
    </p>

    <p>
      We all tried pretty hard to rescue things, we had a session with [a
      professional mediator](http://www.facilitatethis.co.uk/) but that ended
      pretty badly - despite her best efforts, I must say, and she was good at her
      job in my opinion - and we went on to have another series of meetings at the
      CE "away week" in France that summer. But it was pretty clear by then things
      were irrepairably broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that point, myself and SC - who were still on good terms - had a
      stark choice, either: we resign from CE, so SP can do his own thing with the
      business; or we fire SP, because we can't work constructively with him on
      the board of directors. In the end, and for all kinds of reasons, we decided
      it wasn't fair on ourselves or the other people who'd worked hard to get CE
      to where it was to walk away. So we fired SP.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was also pretty simple. We met in London, 2nd August 2012,
      whereupon we explained to SP we felt things weren't working at all - which
      shouldn't have been a surprise, he'd been in the same meetings and arguments
      we had - and we felt the company wasn't going to last much longer if we
      tried to continue with a board that wasn't functional. So, in the now
      immortal words of Alan Sugar, "with regret, you're fired!"
    </p>

    <p>
      He was handed a letter stating the services of Steve Parks Limited
      (SPL), his personal private company through which he insisted on taking his
      salary as a "consultant", were no longer required. He took the letter, we
      told him to get in touch regarding the value of his equity in CE and that we
      were willing to purchase it, he said he would and that's more or less the
      last we heard of him, directly at least.
    </p>

    <p>
      We paid his final invoice and after some time, seeking to settle the
      issue of equity, we began to try to contact SP, since he hadn't contacted us
      to negotiate a price for his equity despite saying he would. There were
      numerous attempts to make contact, some of them official - via solicitors
      with letters sent recorded delivery - some of them personal emails, in an
      attempt to open some sort of dialogue, but none were responded to.
    </p>

    <p>
      CE was stuck, a third of its equity held by a person who was no longer
      involved with the business, but who refused to respond to any effort to
      discuss a purchase of that equity, and there was no shareholder's agreement
      in place to force a sale of the equity. That said, SP didn't hold enough
      equity to really disrupt the running of CE, so we carried on in the hope
      that in the fullness of time a solution would present itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in time it did. In November 2015 our solicitors, who were working on
      <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09803759">a shares
      scheme for CE employees</a>, noticed SPL had gone into liquidation,
      seemingly due to tax evation (read <a
      href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2259380/">the court report</a>,
      it's HMRC - the UK tax office - who called in their debts) and for a not
      insignificant sum (the extent of the debt can be inferred from <a
      href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05096747/filing-history">official
      liquidator's annual report to the courts</a>, seems to be around the £50,000
      mark, and that's a lot of unpaid tax for one guy).
    </p>

    <p>
      This was good news for CE, because SP did everything via SPL, including
      using it as a holding pen for his shares in CE. (Which makes it even more
      astounding SP didn't even attend the court hearing to defend his position
      when SPL was petitioned.) SP wouldn't talk to us, but the liquidator, taking
      over his affairs and trying to recoup around £50,000 from *somewhere*,
      surely would!
    </p>

    <p>
      It's taken over a year for the process to play out, and we navigated
      <a href="https://twitter.com/steveparks/status/707237758788636674">some
      astounding accusations</a> which
      weren't only levelled publicly (the liquidator accepted quickly, and without
      argument, that SPL was paid in full for all services, and
      <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07390130/filing-history">
      a quick look at CE's public accounts</a>
      confirms no dividends were ever paid to anybody EVER, so no one has been
      cheated on that front, in spite of alleged private claims to the contrary),
      but we're now in the final throes, dotting i's and crossing t's at the end
      of the legal process to buy back and cancel CE's equity held by SPL.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I sincerely hope that's the end of the story. It hasn't been
      pleasant, I've heard all kinds of things that have been said about myself
      and SC which are patently untrue (many of which even a rudimentary glance
      over public record would prove them to be so) and I can only exit this
      unfortunate 5 year journey a bit older and a bit wiser, but also -
      unfortunately - a bit more cynical and a bit less trusting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advice to others? If you don't have a proper shareholder's agreement
      that deals with what happens to equity in the event of an acrimonious split,
      sort that out. Tomorrow! Seriously!
